Touch fish mode is fine for me, 
but sometimes when someone needs to look at your files carefully and you don't want them to see what you're looking at,
a one-click exit button is important
Also, is this the place to submit software suggestions? 
If not, I'm very sorry, it's my first time to submit a suggestion on github,
so if it bothers you, please trouble you to delete this file of mine
